# Telecom Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn in the telecom industry using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**. The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and derive actionable insights for retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as **tenure, monthly charges, total charges, contract type, payment method, and demographic details**. The primary objective is to analyze churn trends and visualize patterns.

## Key Insights
- **Tenure & Churn**: Customers with shorter tenure (0-12 months) have the highest churn rate.
- **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts lead to higher churn, whereas longer-term contracts retain more customers.
- **Payment Method**: Customers using electronic checks tend to churn more than those using automatic payments.
- **Demographics & Churn**: Senior citizens and single customers are more likely to churn.
- **Financial Impact**: Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn.

## Visualizations
- **Churn Rate by Tenure Group**
- **Churn vs. Contract Type**
- **Churn by Payment Method**
- **Churn Distribution by Demographics (Gender, Senior Citizen, Partner, Dependents)**
- **Correlation Heatmap for Tenure, Monthly Charges, and Total Charges**
- **Churn Trend Over Time**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Seaborn**
- **Matplotlib**

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Load the dataset:  
   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv("Telco_Customer_Churn_Cleaned.csv")
   ```
3. Run the analysis script to generate insights and visualizations.

## Conclusion
By understanding customer churn trends, telecom companies can **optimize pricing strategies, offer better retention incentives, and improve customer satisfaction**.

### Future Work
- Implement **Machine Learning models** for churn prediction.
- Explore **feature engineering** to enhance predictive power.
- Deploy as a **dashboard** using Power BI or Tableau.
